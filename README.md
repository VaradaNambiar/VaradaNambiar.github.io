## Experience
### **Software Developer**

### **Graduate Software Developer**
#### Oasys Software , Arup
<p>GSA:
<ul>
<li> Rectified critical bugs within the element-member sync feature, which previously resulted in the creation of erroneous elements without user notification, leading to inaccurate model outcomes. </li><ul><li>Wrote class functions to conduct comprehensive pre-sync checks, allowing synchronization only upon successful checks, and alerting users of any issues. <li>Supported the functions with thorough catch2 tests to cover various scenarios, ensuring the reliability and stability of the implemented solution. 
<li>Resulted in enhancing application functionality and mitigating the risk of erroneous model generation.
</ul>
<li>Fixed broken 'Export to IFC' feature
<li>Refactor parts of legacy code
</p>
<p>AdSec:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced UI responsiveness by optimizing the analysis process, implementing multithreading to concurrently analyze packs of load cases. 
  <ul><li>Significantly reduced processing time, enabling quicker task completion and a more seamless user experience.</ul>
  <li> Implemented seamless interoperability between .ads file and API, addressing a critical disconnect issue. 
  <ul><li>Developed a robust parser to read and write adsec files (JSON), enabling efficient manipulation of sections and materials programmatically using the API. 
  <li>Resulted in enhanced user experience as users could effortlessly input file paths int heir scripts, extract section data, perform modifications, and write final results back into the original file.</ul>
  <li> API was made to reference OasysUnits package which required tweaks to oasys generator in addition to API implementation
  <li> Brief stint with VueJS on generating preload table for Staged Analysis feature 
</ul>
