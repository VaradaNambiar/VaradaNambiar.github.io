## Experience

### **Software Developer** - Apr'23 to present

- Designed and developed a custom output feature within GSA software, empowering users to generate tailored result tables directly within the application interface.
  - This eliminated the need to export data to Excel for manual table creation.
  - Presented various implementation design options to enhance existing codebase, then successfully implemented and rigorously tested the feature to ensure seamless integration and user satisfaction.
  - Exposed the feature into COM API
  - Added documentation for users

- Updated MFC UI wizard to include fields for new backend feature.
  - Added buttons, comboboxes, edit fields
  - Linked the user input to existing backend objects

### **Graduate Software Developer** - June'21 to March'23
#### Oasys Software, Arup

#### GSA:

- Rectified critical bugs within the element-member sync feature, which previously resulted in the creation of erroneous elements without user notification, leading to inaccurate model outcomes.
  - Wrote class functions to conduct comprehensive pre-sync checks, allowing synchronization only upon successful checks, and alerting users of any issues.
  - Supported the functions with thorough catch2 tests to cover various scenarios, ensuring the reliability and stability of the implemented solution.
  - Resulted in enhancing application functionality and mitigating the risk of erroneous model generation.

- Fixed broken 'Export to IFC' feature
- Refactored parts of legacy code

#### AdSec:

- Enhanced UI responsiveness by optimizing the analysis process, implementing multithreading to concurrently analyze packs of load cases.
  - Significantly reduced processing time, enabling quicker task completion and a more seamless user experience.
- Implemented seamless interoperability between .ads file and API, addressing a critical disconnect issue.
  - Developed a robust parser to read and write adsec files (JSON), enabling efficient manipulation of sections and materials programmatically using the API.
  - Resulted in enhanced user experience as users could effortlessly input file paths into their scripts, extract section data, perform modifications, and write final results back into the original file.
- API was made to reference OasysUnits package which required tweaks to Oasys generator in addition to API implementation
- Brief stint with VueJS on generating preload table for Staged Analysis feature
